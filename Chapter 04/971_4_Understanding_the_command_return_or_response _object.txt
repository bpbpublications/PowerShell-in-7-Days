# Working with Files
- If you're working with file system objects, you can use Get-Member to discover properties like the file's size, creation time, or last access time.
Get-ChildItem C:\temp\somefile.txt | Get-Member

# Processing CSV Data
- Suppose you're processing CSV data and need to figure out the column names in the file. Get-Member can help:
Import-Csv "C:\Temp\File.csv" | `
Get-Member -MemberType NoteProperty

# Exploring Custom Objects
- If you're working with custom objects or unfamiliar objects returned by cmdlets or functions, you can use Get-Member to understand what you're dealing with:
Get-Process | Get-Member
